ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hazipan, and I'm a self-taught, full stack web developer. I'm experienced with the MERN stack using MongoDB as a database, React as a front end framework paired with TailwindCSS and TypeScript, and Express or Next.js to run the backend. Take a look at my [current project](https://gihub.com/Hazipan/recipe-box)! I'm also currently diving into freelance work by helping local Portland businesses increase and improve their online presence, primarily by building them a stellar website. Professional website for my freelance work is pending, but stay tuned. In the mean time, check out [my portfolio](https://personal-website-omega-drab.vercel.app/) to learn more about me and see some of my projects!
